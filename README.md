Welcome to Memestegram!

Memestegram is a basic web app project to display the progress of the skills we have
gained from Phase 2: React, in our Flatiron bootcamp. In this app, you will find the
functionalities of :

    Routing of the three separate routes home, favorites, and form,

    Liking a post that will toggle a like icon, update the backend which also sends the 
    post to the favorites route in the frontend,

    Unliking a post in the favorites route that will update on the backend and remove 
    the post from the favorites route in the frontend,

    Filtering the posts you would like to see by genre by changing the select bar or by 
    searching by name in the search bar,

    Toggle hide/show comments as well as adding comments under each post which updates the 
    front and backend,

    Deleting a post from the front and backend,

    and lastly, a submission form which can be used to post your own meme, adding it both to the front
    and backend.

    Thanks for checking our work, and happy memeing!
